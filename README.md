Site LaMalletteUGA

[OUTDATED] 

Website realized for a group project in Universit√© Grenoble Alpes.
La Mallette aims to be a centralized ressource for mentoring sessions at uni.
This ressource is made for mentors and contains the necessary ressources to adress the sessions.

It was made following strict conditions where no networking/requests could be used, explaining the lack of auth and databases (although JSON files could be considered as it?).
